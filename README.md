#### ``Objectives``

**Overview:** This project utilizes a Multi-Label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and classify Pokémon based on images. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of Pokémon images, allowing it to predict multiple labels such as type and evolutionary stage. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in multi-label classification, showcasing the potential of CNNs in image recognition tasks.

#### ``Motivations``
**Why is it important?**
- **Technical Insight & Improvement**
    - *Evaluating Accuracy:* Assess the performance of machine learning models in identifying specific characters.
    - *Educational Value:* Practice principles of machine learning and deep learning, particularly CNNs
- **Practical Applications and Broader Impact**
    - *Environmental Monitoring:* Use image recognition to track and identify animals for habitat preservation.
    - *Autonomous Vehicles:* Improve self-driving car's ability to recognize and respond to road objects for enhanced safety and efficiency.

- **Or for the everyday trainer: Pokédex Upgrade**
    - *Gotta Catch 'Em All… Correctly:* Finally make Professor Oak proud with a supercharged Pokedex that never gets a single entry wrong.
